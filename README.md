# Spotify Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Spotify music data to uncover trends in **album types, track distribution, and listener engagement**. The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills using Python—from data wrangling to visualization—and to communicate insights clearly, as expected in a real-world analyst role.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how streams are distributed across different **album types** (Album, Single, Compilation, etc.)
- Compare **track counts and engagement** by album type
- Practice data reshaping and aggregation techniques commonly used by data/product analysts
- Communicate insights through clear visualizations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning, aggregation, reshaping (`groupby`, `value_counts`, `melt`)
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – exploratory analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

1. What is the distribution of tracks across different album types (Album, Single, Compilation)?

2. Which album type contributes the highest total number of streams?

3. How do engagement metrics (likes and views) vary across album types?

4. What is the relationship between views and likes across tracks?

5. How does listener engagement differ when normalized using the likes-to-views ratio?

6. Which album categories dominate overall Spotify content consumption?

7. How can reshaping data (using melt) help compare multiple attributes across album types?

---

## 📊 Summary of Insights

- **Albums** account for the majority of total streams, indicating a strong user preference for full-length releases.
- **Singles** contribute a significant share of tracks but comparatively fewer total streams.
- Engagement patterns vary by album type, which can inform content strategy and release planning.
